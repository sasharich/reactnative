# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

Through following several different online courses over winterim, I taught myself React Native. This react native hack-a-thing was built using this tutorial specifically: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-S5a0eXPoc

My goal was to use it to practice building screens from scratch and adding different blocks, formatting, and pictures (things I previously had no idea how to do). I wanted to do this because I felt behind on the tech stack last term and wanted to make sure I could contribute at a helpful speed this term.

Include some screenshots.

## Who Did What?

I did this all independantly through online tutorials and research.

## What you learned

I learned how to use react native and I was really proud that I was able to build an app by the end of my research/independant learning. I also learned how to test and debug react native (something I was also previously clueless on). I figured out both running it on an iphone simulator on my computer and directly on my phone using the Expo app. I was especially proud of the (numerous instances) where I had a bug and I was able to find the issue in the code and correct it on my own.

In addition to the react native tutorials that I completed, I also wanted to make sure I was up to speed on Google Cloud and SQL (also technologies I had never used before last term), so I watched tutorials such as: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACTtmLWiQY and https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/google-cloud-platform-from-zero-to-hero/ and https://www.javatpoint.com/google-cloud-platform to have more context on google cloud, and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbMHLJ0dY4w to better understand how to use SQL.
